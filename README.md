#PhotoColorNames
**Heterogeneous libraries integrator for image color extraction and naming**

## Usage
A simple example with comments
```php
<?php
### OPTIONAL (depending on settings) ###
// Include autoload - may not be necessary if it has already been done
include __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

// Used classes
/// For color extraction
use PhotoColorNames\PhotoColors\PhotoColorFactory;
use PhotoColorNames\PhotoColors\PhotoColorOptions;
/// For color naming
use PhotoColorNames\ColorNames\ColorNamesFactory;
use PhotoColorNames\ColorNames\NamePool;
use PhotoColorNames\NameColor;
### END OF OPTIONAL ###

### MAIN ###
// Extract colors
/// Use the factory to retrieve a new object for color extraction
$photoColors = PhotoColorFactory::getColorExtractor('ColorThief'); // Has to be installed via composer - 'GetMostCommonColors' can be used instead
/// Specify options - the most important is the file path
$photoColorOptions = new PhotoColorNames\PhotoColors\PhotoColorExtractorOptions(__DIR__ . '/test/images/test.jpg'); // Assuming there is a test image at this path
// Manually set each option, or set all options except the file path to their default value
$photoColorOptions->setDefaultOptions();

// Name the colors
/// Use the factory to retrieve a new object for color naming
$nameGiver = ColorNamesFactory::getColorNameGiver('ntc');
/// Use a list of names
$nameList = NamePool::getNtcNames();

// Construct object using the 4 variables declared before
$nameColor = new NameColor($photoColors, $photoColorOptions, $nameGiver, $nameList);

// Use the newly created object to get the names of the most frequently used colors in the file
$x = $nameColor->getNamesOfFrequentlyUsedColors();
### END OF MAIN ###

// Print result (not part of MAIN because it's not necessary)
print_r($x);
```
#### Extractor options
New extractor options classes can be specified, but have to be paired with the color extractor class

## Adding new libraries
### By Source
#### Composer
Just add it to composer.json and install. Composer will integrate it easily into the project.
#### Non-composer
It is recommended, though not enforced, to place it into the **NoComposer** folder under the **ColorNames** or **PhotoColors** folders depending on the purpose of the new library.

### By Type
#### Color Extractors
##### Libraries
1. An adapter must be created in src/PhotoColors/Adapters
2. The adapter must implement iPhotoColorExtractor
   - has a function called **getColors**
   - has 1 parameter
     - **$photoColorExtractorOptions** of type **PhotoColorExtractorOptions** 
   - implements all the logic necessary to issue the same type of results like the examples from 5 (no return type enforced since it's designed to run on PHP >= 5.6)
3. The action of constructing an object of the adapter's type must be placed in a new case under the switch from the method **getColorExtractor** from **PhotoColorFactory**
4. The new library can be used by creating an object from the factory
   ```php
   PhotoColorFactory::getColorExtractor('ColorExtractorLibrary');
   ```
5. Examples
   - PhotoColorNames\PhotoColors\Adapters\ColorThiefAdapter
   - GetMostCommonColorsAdapter

#### Color Names
##### Libraries
1. An adapter must be created in src/ColorNames/Adapters
2. The adapter must implement iPhotoColorNamesGiver
   - has a function called **getName**
   - has 2 parameters
     - **$colorName** of type **ColorData** 
     - **$nameList** of type **array**
   - implements all the logic necessary to issue the same type of results like the example from 5 (no return type enforced since it's designed to run on PHP >= 5.6)
3. The action of constructing an object of the adapter's type must be placed in a new case under the switch from the method **getColorNameGiver** from **ColorNamesFactory**
4. The new library can be used by creating an object from the factory
   ```php
   ColorNamesFactory::getColorNameGiver('ColorNamingLibrary');
   ```
5. Examples
   - PhotoColorNames\ColorNames\Adapters\NtcAdapter
##### Name lists
It is recommended, though not enforced, to add new name lists to **NamePool** as a static method that returns an array which has the key as the color's RGB hex code and the value as an array containing the name
